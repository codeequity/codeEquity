
CodeEquity is based on a simple truth: ***If you help create something, you should
be among those that benefit from it***.

Traditional established companies pay employee salaries, promise stability, and provide many perks
including: insurance, retirement plans, office space, computing environments, lots of free coffee, and
more.  In return, those companies own all of the output of every one of their employees.  Startup
companies are similar, but in place of stability, retirement plans, and competitive wages,
they offer small amounts of equity in order to attract skilled employees.

There are other models for organizing teams to create products.  GitHub is perhaps the best known
developer platform available currently.  GitHub provides a space for the primary alternative today
in the software development world.  Most new ventures in the GitHub space do not offer money or
equity to compensate skilled contributors.  Nor do they offer office space, insurance, retirement
plans, or lots of free coffee.  Instead, they offer social recognition and a sense of purpose.
These incentives can be powerful, but only up to a point.

CodeEquity proposes that these new ventures additionally offer up their primary currency - 
***ownership*** - as the key incentive to attract skilled contributors.  CodeEquity is both a legal
framework and a software framework that makes this simple idea easy to put into practice, and
iron-clad should the venture become successful down the road.

In the big picture, CodeEquity is an attack on the greatest remaining barrier to large scale
technical innovation: the human factor.  Up until now, the necessary ingredients for a venture to
take off have been: lots of money to pay for wages, stuff and services, some luck, and a good idea.
Some luck and a good idea will always be necessary components for success, but startup money?  The
underlying equation has changed over the last decade with the advent of dependable internet and
cloud-based compute services, code and project management.  We no longer need most of the trappings
of a traditional company. What's left is the human factor: How do you attract several person-years
of skilled, dedicated help without the money to pay wages?  Fully sharing equity is the only answer
that has a chance to reshape or destroy this final blocker to full merit-based technical innovation.

How much more dynamic, inventive and sizeable would the GitHub community be if contributors saw the
potential, however slight, of making a living or better by contributing to a project?

For the *potential contributor* the choice is clear.  All else being equal between two projects of
equal merit, one of which is a CodeEquity project, and one which is not, why contribute to the
project that does not share equity?

For the *founders* the choice is easy as well.  Most new ventures find it hard to attract skilled
contributors.  Is there a more powerful way to attract them than by offering equity?  Doing so will
reduce the equity you can retain personally ... but the equity you do retain has a much higher chance
of being worth something down the road if you can get good help early on.

For the potential contributor to CodeEquity software itself, well, yes, we are a CodeEquity project,
so consider joining the team!
