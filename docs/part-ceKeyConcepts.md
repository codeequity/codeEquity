## CodeEquity Key Concepts

Equity in a CodeEquity project is earned by making contributions to that project.  In a typical
company, equity is granted once a year to a person privately based on the subjective
evaluation of that person's boss.  In contrast, equity in a CodeEquity project can be earned at any point during
the year.  The equity value of any contribution is known to all, up front, and the accrual of equity
is both objective and public.

Several common CodeEquity terms and concepts are introduced below, primarily to help make
the manual concise and understandable.  These introductions are for common reference only.  For
binding definitions and details, refer to the **CodeEquity Venture Equity Agreement**.


### CodeEquity Ventures & Projects

A CodeEquity Venture is analogous to a company.  Equity within a company is separate and distinct
from equity within a second company.  A CodeEquity Project is analogous to a project, or part of a
project within a company.  Equity within a company may be earmarked for different projects or
purposes within that company.

For example, Jessie has a great idea for an app that allows people within a community to browse,
borrow, and loan books with each-other, and has decided to pursue this idea within the CodeEquity
framework.  Jessie is calling the app "BookShare".  To simplify planning, Jessie decides to break the app's
development tasks into several smaller projects: *BookShare frontend*, *BookShare backend*, and *BookShare
operations*.  In this example, the CodeEquity Venture is BookShare.  The Venture is made up of three
CodeEquity Projects: *BookShare frontend*, *BookShare backend*, and *BookShare operations*.
CodeEquity will track and collate provisional equity across the three projects and report it within
the umbrella of the Venture: BookShare.  Jessie could have chosen a different way to structure
BookShare within the CodeEquity framework, but this breakdown is simple and functional.


### Provisional Equity (PEQ)

In point of fact, *equity* is not earned in CodeEquity Ventures, but rather *provisional equity* is.
Equity in a company requires the company to exist as a legal entity such as an LLC or a Corporation.
This is not a useful step for most early ventures.  It takes time and money to set up these
entities, both of which can be better spent developing and testing the ideas for the venture.

Provisional equity are normal stock options, provisional on the venture being converted into a legal
business entity at some point in the future.  The CodeEquity promise, secured by the CodeEquity legal framework, is that every
share of provisional equity owned by a contributor will be converted 1:1 to a stock option in any
company created from the venture.  Furthermore, any revenue gained by a CodeEquity Venture (for
example, with the sale of related intellectual property) that is not fed back into the venture will
be split among contributors according to how many shares of Provisional Equity they have accrued.

For binding definitions and details, refer to **Provisional Stock Options** in the **CodeEquity Venture Equity Agreement**.  
For simplicity of reference throughout CodeEquity, one provisional stock option is denoted as *1 PEQ*,
or *one share of provisional equity*.


### PEQ Issues

A CodeEquity Project will normally be planned and tracked with a collection of *issues* managed 
with project management software, such as GitHub project boards.  Common issues
involve planned features, feature requests, bug reports, and operational tasks.

A PEQ issue is any issue that has a PEQ value attached to it.  For example, the *BookShare frontend*
project might have an issue: "Add book detail page".  Without an associated PEQ value, this is not a
PEQ issue.  Once Jessie adds, say, a "1000 PEQ" label to the issue, it becomes a PEQ issue and will
be subsequently tracked by CodeEquity software.


### CodeEquity Software Framework Mandate

All elements of CodeEquity's software exist to aid in tracking and managing the provisional equity
associated with a CodeEquity Venture.  This responsibility lasts up until when the Venture converts
to a legal corporate entity and the provisional shares are converted to stock options in that new
entity, at which point the new legal entity takes over.

To support this mandate, CodeEquity software tracks and stores every action that impacts the
resolution of every PEQ issue.  Likewise, CodeEquity is free to ignore actions that
have no impact on the resolution of non-PEQ issues.  For example, CodeEquity tracks
operations like adding a PEQ label to an issue, closing a PEQ issue, or changing who is assigned to
a PEQ issue.  For example, CodeEquity ignores operations like creating an issue that does not have a
PEQ label, adding a comment to an issue, or changing the name of a project column that does not have
associated PEQ issues.

CodeEquity ensures that once PEQs have accrued (i.e. provisional equity has
been earned by a contributor), all characteristics of those PEQs are immutable.  For example, if
Alex earned 1000 PEQs for implementing a new feature for BookShare, they can not be taken away or
changed down the road.
